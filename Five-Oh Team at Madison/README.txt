Site Story:

Plans were in the making from the moment it was announced to the class that
we would be creating a website for a company, organization, or club that
needs a website made, or an updated website. A meeting was then held with
officer stone, and it was decided that we would be creating a site for
Explorer Post 276. We made sure to keep him informed on all of our changes.
Everything from format and color scheme to site content and wording was
approved by Stone prior to the website. All information was either from
our own experiences within the post, or from the facebook page and Stone
himself. 



Overall Site Description:

We decided to design our website to be appealing to new recruits looking to
join, as well as make the text large for parents and grandparents to be 
able to read the content that is on it. We also considered the fact that
this was a site for our Police Department, so our color scheme resembles
the thin blue line (black and blue), along with colors of the Explorer Post
uniforms (grey and black).

The resposiveness was a difficult task. We would have an idea on how to fix
an issue, and it would fix one problem, but produce 3-5 more in the process.
We finally decided to backtrack, and try a different approach, and this time,
it solved the issue, and created minimule, to no issues with any other code, 
and did not conflict with anything on the site. We can quarantee you that
you will find minimal or no issues in the responsiveness, up to the
size of our Mac!

The image you see as the logo is the post patch 276. The favicon is also a 
patch that is frequently used in the post. We questioned stone on if he would
like our badge or patch as the site logo, and even offered Stone a custom 
logo, such as a shield with the Post Number, and he chose the patch for the
site logo.

Our contact information was placed in the footer. Therefore, no matter the
page you are on, you can always contact us. It includes the link to the
facebook page, a google maps link to the location of our our post meetings,
the phone number to contact the post immediately, and the email to contact 
the post for a less minor message.

**SITE DESCRIPTION:**
The explorer program is a program for young adults looking to go into public 
service. This is who we made our site for. We chose Explorer post 276 because
the program has been a great influence on the lives of many young adults. 
Throughout the process of making this site, we had many grievances such as the
fact that media queries refused to cooperate. Websites like ours were hard to start with 
but the longer that we worked on it, the better we got at advancing it.
